# LoopyV: A 5-Stage Pipelined RISC-V Processor

LoopyV is a SystemVerilog implementation of a RISC-V processor featuring a 5-stage pipeline architecture. This processor is designed to provide efficient instruction execution while maintaining a balance between performance and complexity.

## Pipeline Stages
 LoopyV implements the following pipeline stages: 
 1. Instruction Fetch (IF)
 2. Instruction Decode (ID)
 3. Execute (EX)
 4. Memory (MEM)
 5. Write-back (WB)

## Key Features
- Full implementation of the RISC-V 32-Bit integer ISA
- Hazard detection and forwarding units for efficient pipeline operation
- Memory interface for instruction and data access
